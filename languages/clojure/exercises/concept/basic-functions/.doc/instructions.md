In this exercise you'll be creating some functions which work with the number 42, sometimes referred to as "the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe."

You have three tasks.

### 1. Create a function that returns 42

First, create a function that simply returns the number 42 every time it is invoked.

### 2. Create a function that accepts an input and adds 42 to it 

Now create a function that takes one input argument and returns the sum of that argument and the number 42.

### 3. Create a function that takes and argument and calls function defined in (2) with it

Finally, create a function that accepts an input, uses it as the argument with which to call the function defined in (2), and then returns the result of that function invocation.
