# UTF-32

> UTF-32 is a fixed-length [character encoding][concept-encoding] capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid [code points][concept-encoding] in Unicode using exactly 32 bits (four [8-bit][type-bit] [bytes][type-bytes]) per code point. Each 32-bit value in UTF-32 represents one Unicode code point and is exactly equal to that code point's numerical value.
